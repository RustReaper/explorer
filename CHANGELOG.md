<!--

## A short guide to adding a changelog entry

- pick a section to which your change belongs in _Forest Explorer unreleased_,
- the entry should follow the format:

  `[#ISSUE_NO](link to the issue): <short description>`, for example:

  [#1234](https://github.com/chainsafe/forest-explorer/pull/1234): Add support for pineconenet

- if the change does not have an issue, use the PR number instead - the PR must
  have a detailed description of the change and its motivation. Consider
  creating a separate issue if the change is complex enough to warrant it,
- the changelog is not a place for the full description of the change, it should
  be a short summary of the change,
- if the change does not directly affect the user, it should not be included in
  the changelog - for example, refactoring of the codebase,
- review the entry to make sure it is correct and understandable and that it
  does not contain any typos,
- the entries should not contradict each other - if you add a new entry, ensure
  it is consistent with the existing entries.
